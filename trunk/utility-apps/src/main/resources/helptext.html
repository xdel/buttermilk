	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Welcome to the <b>cryptoregistry.com</b> registration wizard. This wizard helps build your first 
	Buttermilk-formatted cryptographic key pair and then digitally sign a registration request using that key. 
	You will then upload the request file to start the registration process.</p>
	
	<p>The registration wizard consists of several tabs. These are intended to be used in order:</p> 
	
	<ol>
		<li>Introduction (this tab)</li>
		<li>Settings</li>
		<li>Select Registration Handle</li>
	    <li>Initial Key</li>
	    <li>Personal Contact (Can Be Anonymous)</li>
	    <li>Business Contact (Optional)</li>
	    <li>Web site Contact (Optional)</li>
	    <li>Signature</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Each tab builds the registration file starting with the registration handle itself and then moving through
	your initial encryption key, contact info appropriate to your situation, and finally a digital signature using your
	own key.</p>
	
	<h2>Settings</h2>
	
	<p>Define where you would like the application to save the generated key materials, and other settings.</p>
	
	<h2>Select Registration Handle</h2>
	
	<p>This tab allows you to compose a registration handle and verify if it is available. It requires an 
	Internet connection to make contact with cryptoregistry.com to check on handles.</p>
	
	<h2>Initial Key</h2>
	
	<p>Once you have created a candidate registration handle, this tab allows you to generate an 
	 asymmetric cryptographic key which will be used to sign the registration request.
	 You may select from one of three algorithms for the key. The generated key will have a for-publication (public) portion,
	 which is sent to cryptoregistry.com, and also a secured (private) portion which is used for signing or encrypting
	 messages, etc. The secured portion is encrypted and placed in a separate file, which is why you must supply a password, and you must keep the file
	 and the associated password secure. </p>
	 
	 <p>This password and the generated secured key file are not communicated to cryptoregistry.com.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Personal Contact</h2>
	 
	 <p>If the context of your security requirements is for securing personal communications then you can create a 
	 personal contact record. This information will be made viewable on cryptoregistry.com so only include what 
	 you are comfortable having available on-line. If you are not comfortable with having any information on-line,
	 then use the checkbox for creating an anonymous record.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Business Contact</h2>
	 
	 <p>If the context of your security requirements is for business use then you can create a 
	 business contact record. This information will be made viewable on cryptoregistry.com so only include what 
	 you are comfortable having available on-line.</p>
	 
	  <h2>Website Contact</h2>
	 
	 <p>If the context of your security requirements is for web site use (similar to a legacy digital certificate)
	 then you can create one or more web site contact records. This information should be essentially the same values
	 as what is defined in WHOIS (So it can be verified).</p>
	 
	 
	 <h2>Signature</h2>
	 
	 <p>This tab allows you to sign all the preceding information you have input using the key you just created. It is essentially
	 a "self-signed" assertion which proves specifically only that you have possession of the secured portion of the
	 cryptographic key found in the keys section.</p>

	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	
	<h2>What is Public Key Infrastructure</h2>
	
	<p>Public Key Infrastructure or PKI is infrastructure which is concerned with securing information. It uses the
	basic techniques of cryptography - encryption, digital signature, and identity management - to create an
	environment in which information can be protected and managed.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2>What Is <b>cryptoregistry.com</b>?</h2>
	
	<p><b>cryptoregistry.com</b> is part of a new Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) designed by David R. Smith. 
	The PKI design consists
	of an open source cryptographic library implemented in the Java programming language, called Buttermilk; a new
	security protocol (loosely modeled on TLS) called bTLS (aka "beatles"); new cryptographic formats,
	utilities, and programs, and a web site to support it all.</p>
	
	<h2>What is a Handle?</h2>
	
	<p>Handles are UTF-8 encoded text strings which follow certain formatting rules. Handles are intended to work as a moniker 
	or nick-name for all your PKI use. They are intentionally oriented towards individuals, but also can be used for
	other entities such as  businesses and web sites.</p>
	
	<p>The handle provides <i>a unique lookup</i> to locate your key materials 
	in the registry, but it also allows Identity Points&trade; and other trust materials to adhere.</p>
	
	<p>Just to get a flavor of what is possible, here are some examples of valid formatted handles:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Chinese Knees</li>
		<li>社会主义 吮吸</li>
		<li>ba80f000-d054-11e4-8477-0002a5d5c51b</li>
		<li>mywebsite.com.au</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These examples may not seem to have much in common but they all conform to the following rules:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Consists of more than one "word" with a separator character</li>
		<li>The "words" may consist of any combination of UTF-8 characters, max length of a word is 128 bytes</li>
		<li>The "words" are separated by either a space, a dash, or a dot (period).</li>
		<li>If the separator is a <i>dot (period)</i> character, then parsing rules for domain names are in play.</li>
		<li>If the separator is a <i>dash</i>, then parsing rules for UUIDs are in play.</li>
	</ol> 
	
	<p>The first example, "Chinese Knees", is a typical or human-readable handle. It uses spaces 
	(in this case one space) to separate words.</p>
	
	<p>The second example is in Chinese characters - which works fine for our purposes.</p>
	
	<p>The third example is a machine-generated UUID, which is also acceptable as a handle. It has "words"
	separated by dashes, but no spaces or periods.</p>
	
	<p>The fourth example is a domain name. Every domain name is a potential handle, but not every handle would
	qualify as a domain name.</p>
	
	<h2>What is a Registration Handle&trade;?</h2>
	
	<p>A registration handle is a handle chosen by a registrant (i.e., you) for use with a cryptoregistry.com registration.</p>
	
	<p>The registration handle will be publicly visible and internet-searchable, and depending on the level of
	PKI validation your use-case requires, it ties back directly to contact details about you or your business,
	so it is worth thinking about and choosing wisely. You are only allowed to have one personal handle and
	one handle per business or web site entity which you legally control.</p>
	
	<p>Some guidelines on defining a handle, more are found in the Terms of Service:</p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Do not include your legal name or personally identifiable details like phone numbers in your personal handle. 
		There are millions of people named John Smith. Try to think of something
		more original which fits your personality. Also be aware that while phone numbers may change with relative ease,
		your digital signatures are harder to adjust.</li>
		<li>You can use your legal business name as a business registration Handle, but keep in mind you must own the
		trademark for that phrase or name.</li>
		<li>You must claim copyright as part of your handle creation upon registration. I.e., you must assert the handle
		is your unique intellectual property and creatively yours.</li>
		<li>If you cannot think of anything creative, a unique UUID can be generated instead - but this is harder to remember
		or tell your friends.</li>
		<li>Pornographic or sexually offensive phrases are not allowed, although a certain amount of 
		creative license is reasonable. Do you
		really want people to look up your on-line handle by searching for "Big Dick 10?" Unless you
		are a working porn star you should choose something less provocative.</li> 
		<li>Hate speech or any speech which is considered defamatory, slanderous, or libelous, is not allowed 
		in a registration handle.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>What are Key Materials&trade;?</h2>
	
	<p>Key Materials&trade; is our term for the menage of cryptographic materials such as keys, digital signatures, etc.,
	in various formats such as JSON or Google protocol buffers as used by the Buttermilk project.</p>
	
	<h2>Does cryptoregistry.com perform x509 Certificate Signing or Certificate Authority Services?</h2>
	
	<p>No. cryptoregistry.com is a new and different Public Key Infrastructure and does not perform services
	associated with x509 Certificates.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Can I register my domain name at the same time as I create a registration Handle?</h2>
	
	<p>No. cryptoregistry.com does not offer domain name registration services at this time. Do that first.</p>
