	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Welcome to the <b>cryptoregistry.com</b> Registration Wizard. This wizard helps build your first 
	Buttermilk-formatted cryptographic key pair and then digitally sign a registration request using that key. 
	You will then upload the request file to start the registration process.</p>
	
	<p>The registration wizard consists of several tabs. These are intended to be used more or less in order, but you can go backwards if required:</p> 
	
	<ol>
		<li>Introduction (this tab)</li>
		<li>Settings</li>
		<li>Select Registration Handle</li>
	    <li>Initial Key</li>
	    <li>Personal Contact (Can Be Anonymous)</li>
	    <li>Business Contact (Optional)</li>
	    <li>Web site Contact (Optional)</li>
	    <li>Signature</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Each tab builds the registration data set starting with the location on your file system for the generated key materials,
	selecting the registration handle itself by checking availability, and then moving through to creation of your initial 
	encryption key, contact info appropriate to your situation, and finally a digital signature using your own key.</p>
	
	<h2>Settings</h2>
	
	<p>Define where you would like the application to save the generated key materials, and a private email address. This "private"
	address is not included in the registration and not presented to the public; it is used to send a confirmation email only. If
	this field is left blank, no confirmation email will be sent.</p>
	
	<h2>Select Registration Handle</h2>
	
	<p>This tab allows you to compose a registration handle and verify if it is available. It requires an Internet connection to make 
	contact with cryptoregistry.com to check on handles. See below in the FAQ for a definition of a "registration handle". Basically, this
	value is a unique moniker that can be used by other people to find your listing in the registry.</p>
	
	<h2>Initial Key</h2>
	
	<p>Once you have created a candidate registration handle, this tab allows you to generate an asymmetric cryptographic key which
	 will be used to sign the registration request. You may select from one of three algorithms for the key. The generated key will have a 
	 for-publication (public) portion, which is sent to cryptoregistry.com, and also a secured (private) portion which is used for signing or encrypting
	 messages, etc. The secured portion is encrypted and placed in a separate file, which is why you must supply a password, and you must keep the file
	 and the associated password secure.</p>
	 
	 <p>This password and the generated secured key file are not communicated to cryptoregistry.com.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Personal Contact</h2>
	 
	 <p>If the context of your security requirements is for securing personal communications then you can create a 
	 personal contact record. This information will be made viewable on cryptoregistry.com so only include what 
	 you are comfortable having available on-line. If you are not comfortable with having any information on-line,
	 then use the checkbox for creating an anonymous record.</p>
	 
	 <p>Note that if your registration handle is in domain name form (i.e., if you use periods or "full stops" as separators)
	 then this tab will be disabled and you will be required to use the Website Contact form.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Business Contact</h2>
	 
	 <p>If the context of your security requirements is for business use then you can create a 
	 business contact record. This information will be made viewable on cryptoregistry.com so only include what 
	 you are comfortable having available on-line.</p>
	 
	  <h2>Website Contact</h2>
	 
	 <p>If the context of your security requirements is for web site use (similar to a legacy digital certificate)
	 then you can create one or more web site contact records. This is automatically detected because your handle must be
	 in domain name form in order to use this tab. This information should be entered exactly the same values
	 as what is defined in WHOIS (So it can be verified later).</p>
	 
	 <p>Note: you do not need to fill in all the fields, and you do not need multiple records (Registrant, Administrative, etc.) unless
	 you want to have those. </p>
	 
	 
	 <h2>Signature</h2>
	 
	 <p>This tab allows you to sign all the preceding information you have input using the key you just created. We call
	 this a "CryptoSignature." It is essentially a "self-signed" assertion which proves specifically only that you have 
	 possession of the secured portion of the cryptographic key found in the keys section. Still, this is useful. Public Key 
	 Infrastructure is based on this concept: if you are in possession of the secret key, then you are an authenticated Subject.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Key Materials</h2>
	 
	 <p>After you have created the digital signature you will be taken to a tab which displays the generated key materials.
	 These are also written to the file system for future reference, along with an obfuscated password file if you kept
	 that box checked. At this point, if all the check boxes to the right are checked, the "Send Registration Request" 
	 button will be enabled.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Registration</h2>
	 
	<p>At this point you can register in one of two ways: </p>
	
	<ol><li>press the "Send Registration Request" button</li>
	<li> or visit
	<a href="https://www.cryptoregistry.com/registration/reg-form-direct.jsp">https://www.cryptoregistry.com/registration/reg-form-direct.jsp</a>
	page and paste in the contents of the left pane and then press submit.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p> The end result is the same: the registration will be processed and if successful, an email will be generated
	to the "private" email address you entered above, assuming that field was filled in with a valid address.</p>

	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	
	<h2>What is Public Key Infrastructure?</h2>
	
	<p>Public Key Infrastructure or PKI is network or Internet infrastructure which is concerned with securing information. 
	It uses the  techniques of cryptography - encryption, digital signature, and identity management - to create an environment in 
	which information can be managed securely and your privacy protected.</p>
	
	<h2>What Is <b>cryptoregistry.com</b>?</h2>
	
	<p><b>cryptoregistry.com</b> is part of a new Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) designed by David R. Smith. 
	The PKI design consists of an open source cryptographic library implemented in the Java programming language, 
	called Buttermilk; a new security protocol (loosely modeled on TLS) called bTLS (pronounced "beatles"); new cryptographic formats,
	utilities, and programs, and a web site to support it all.</p>
	
	<h2>Where is the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service agreement for cryptoregistry.com?</h2>
	
	<p>Here: <a href="https://www.cryptoregistry.com/tos.html">TOS</a> and <a href="https://www.cryptoregistry.com/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.<p> 
	
	<h2>Does cryptoregistry.com sell or resell information users or registrants submit?</h2>
	
	<p>No. Cryptoregistry.com does not sell or resell its database contents. The information submitted by users remains theirs and is 
	copyrighted by the submitter. This is explained in more detail in the Terms of Service.</p>
	
	<h2>What is a Handle?</h2>
	
	<p>Handles are UTF-8 encoded text strings - possibly a phrase - which follow certain syntax rules. Handles are intended to work as a moniker 
	or "nick-name" for all your PKI use. This is a little different from any existing way of using cryptographic keys or digital signatures,
	and the method is a distinguishing characteristic of the cryptoregistry.com PKI.</p>
	
	<p>Handles are intentionally oriented towards individuals, but also can be used for other entities such as businesses and web sites.</p>
	
	<p>The handle provides <i>a unique lookup</i> to locate your registration.</p>
	
	<p>Just to get a flavor of what is possible, here are some examples of valid formatted handles:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Chinese Knees</li>
		<li>社会主义 吮吸</li>
		<li>ba80f000-d054-11e4-8477-0002a5d5c51b</li>
		<li>mywebsite.com.au</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These examples may not seem to have much in common but they all conform to the following rules:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Consists of more than one "word" with a separator character</li>
		<li>The "words" may consist of any combination of UTF-8 characters, max length of a word is 128 bytes</li>
		<li>The "words" are separated by either a space, a dash, or a dot (period).</li>
		<li>If the separator is a <i>dot (period)</i> character, then parsing rules for DNS (Domain Names) are in play.</li>
		<li>If the separator is a <i>dash</i>, then parsing rules for UUIDs are in play.</li>
	</ol> 
	
	<p>The first example, "Chinese Knees", is a typical or human-readable handle. It uses spaces 
	(in this case one space) to separate words.</p>
	
	<p>The second example is in Chinese characters - which works fine for our purposes.</p>
	
	<p>The third example is a machine-generated UUID, which is also acceptable as a handle. It has "words"
	separated by dashes, but no spaces or periods.</p>
	
	<p>The fourth example is a domain name. Every domain name is a potential handle, but not every handle would
	qualify as a domain name.</p>
	
	<h2>What is a Registration Handle&trade;?</h2>
	
	<p>A registration handle is a handle chosen by a registrant for use with a cryptoregistry.com registration.</p>
	
	<p>The registration handle will be <b>publicly visible</b> and <b>internet-searchable</b>, and depending on the level of
	PKI validation your use-case requires, it ties back directly to contact details about you or your business or web site,
	so it is worth thinking about and choosing wisely.</p>
	
	<p>Some guidelines on defining a handle, more are found in the Terms of Service:</p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Do not include your legal name or personally identifiable details. Consider closely whether phone numbers or other
		ID numbers are a good idea - usually they would not be.</li> 
		<li>There are millions of people named John Smith. Try to think of something
		 more original than your name, a nickname you like, something which fits your true self or says something 
		 about you that is unique.</li>
		<li>You can use your legal business name as a business registration Handle, but keep in mind you must own the
		trademark for that phrase or name to do this.</li>
		<li>You must claim copyright as part of your handle creation upon registration. I.e., you must assert the handle
		is your unique intellectual property and creatively yours. If it is found later this is not the case, you will be in
		violation of the Terms of Service and your registration may be deleted as a consequence.</li>
		<li>Pornographic or sexually offensive phrases are not allowed and are a violation of the Terms of Service, although a certain amount of 
		creative license is reasonable. Do you really want people to look up your on-line handle by searching 
		for "Big Dick #10?" Unless you are a working porn star you should probably choose something less provocative.</li> 
		<li>Hate speech or any speech which is considered defamatory, slanderous, or libelous, is not allowed 
		in a registration handle and is a violation of the Terms of Service.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>What are Key Materials&trade;?</h2>
	
	<p>Key Materials&trade; is our term for the ménage of cryptographic materials such as keys, digital signatures, etc.,
	in various formats such as JSON or Google protocol buffers as used by the Buttermilk project.</p>
	
	<h2>Does cryptoregistry.com perform x509 Certificate Signing or Certificate Authority Services?</h2>
	
	<p>No. cryptoregistry.com is a new and different Public Key Infrastructure and does not perform services
	associated with x509 Certificates.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Can I register my domain name at the same time as I create a registration Handle?</h2>
	
	<p>No. cryptoregistry.com does not offer domain name registration services at this time. Do that first.</p>
